## Overview of Annolid
Annolid is an annotation and instance segmentation-based multiple animal tracking and behavior analysis package.
Annolid treats keypoints-based pose estimation as a special case of instance segmentation.
Instance mask area and perimeter can be tracked, as well as keypoints.


## Getting Started
Learning yet another tool for behavior tracking and analysis is tough and takes time. With this in mind we tried to make it as simple as possible for you to evaluate if annolid is the right fit for your research needs.


## Exemples
