        Forward SAM prompt encoders and mask heads.
        We run the propagation head, the interactive head, or both, based on the inputs.

        Inputs:
        - backbone_features: image features of [B, C, H, W] shape
        - point_inputs: a dictionary with "point_coords" and "point_labels", where
          1) "point_coords" has [B, P, 2] shape and float32 dtype and contains the
             absolute pixel-unit coordinate in (x, y) format of the P input points
          2) "point_labels" has shape [B, P] and int32 dtype, where 1 means
             positive clicks, 0 means negative clicks, and -1 means padding
        - mask_inputs: a mask of [B, 1, H*16, W*16] shape, float or bool, with the
          same spatial size as the image.
        - high_res_features: either 1) None or 2) a list of length 2 containing
          two feature maps of [B, C, 4*H, 4*W] and [B, C, 2*H, 2*W] shapes respectively,
          which will be used as high-resolution feature maps for SAM decoder.
        - multimask_output: if it's True, we output 3 candidate masks and their 3
          corresponding IoU estimates, and if it's False, we output only 1 mask and
          its corresponding IoU estimate.

        Outputs:
        - low_res_multimasks: [B, M, H*4, W*4] shape (where M = 3 if
          `multimask_output=True` and M = 1 if `multimask_output=False`), the SAM
          output mask logits (before sigmoid) for the low-resolution masks, with 4x
          the resolution (1/4 stride) of the input backbone_features.
        - high_res_multimasks: [B, M, H*16, W*16] shape (where M = 3
          if `multimask_output=True` and M = 1 if `multimask_output=False`),
          upsampled from the low-resolution masks, with shape size as the image
          (stride is 1 pixel).
        - ious: [B, M] shape (where M = 3 if `multimask_output=True` and M = 1
          if `multimask_output=False`), the estimated IoU of each output mask.
        - low_res_masks: [B, 1, H*4, W*4] shape, the best mask in `low_res_multimasks`.
          If `multimask_output=True`, it's the mask with the highest IoU estimate.

        There are four different modes that track_step might enter, based on the inputs
        1. Mask-as-output. This is when mask_inputs is not None.
           The input mask is returned directly. This case is for FA/VOS initialization.
        2. Propagation-only. This is when mask_inputs and point_inputs are empty.
           We propagate masks using the memory only. This case is for VOS propagation.
        3. Interaction-only. This is when mask_inputs is None, point_inputs is not None,
           and one of the followings is satisified:
           a) prev_sam_mask_logits is not None. In this case, we refine prev_sam_mask_logits
              with additional interactions, updating only the objects specified in objects_to_interact.
              objects_to_interact must not be None.
              This occurs when we refine the same frame with multiple point inputs iteratively.
           b) prev_sam_mask_logits is None, and is_init_cond_frame is True.
              This case is for initializing the first frame. All objects will have point inputs.
              This mostly happens during training/interactive eval.
        4. Propagation-and-interaction. This is when mask_inputs is None, point_inputs is not None,
           prev_sam_mask_logits is None, and objects_to_interact is not None.
           This is when we are propagating to a new frame that has point inputs (from previous interactions).
           This is more of an edge case that could happen in offline interactive eval.
           We first propagate the mask to the current frame, and then perform interaction on the selected
           objects. Finally, we replace the masks of the interacted objects in the propagated output
           with the masks from the interaction output.

        This function, in addition to the prompt preparation done in the parent class, preprocesses the
        masks and pre-computes visibility/validity attributes necessary for training with dynamic bucketing.

        **Data**
        We use a modified dataset class and a modified collate_fn such that:
        1. The mask for an object is loaded if it is visible (area>0) on any of the loaded frames
        2. A "visible_objects_per_frame" attribute is computed, which contains the set of objects with area>0 on each frame

        Here, we use [] to denote a set of objects; i.e., object A and B are represented as [A, B].
        Consider the masks given by the dataloader in an arbitrary yet deterministic order.
        That is, [2, 3] can appear on the first frame, and [1, 2, 3, 17] can appear on the second frame.

        This is incompatible with the object addition implementation, since we assume new objects are appended, not inserted.
        Thus, we compute object_appearance_order which sorts the object idx using the frame at which they appear
        (conditional frames always appear first). For objects that appear on the same frame, we shuffle them as augmentation.
        We also reorder the ground-truth masks used for supervision.

        **Causal supervision**
        Since not all objects appear on the first frame, we should not supervise on the objects that the model has no knowledge of yet.
        Thus, we keep track of the set of objects that have been introduced, and the frame at which that happens.
        We compute valid_idx_per_frame (and correspondingly trim the ground-truth) to enforce reasonable supervisions.

        **Transition points**
        Transition points are non-initial-conditioning frames that introduce new objects. We uniformly sample some frames
        to be candidates for transition points, and use them if they actually introduce new objects compared to the last seen
        conditional frame/transition point.
        Transitions do not always happen when an object first becomes visible, because our (initial) sampling is agnostic to visibility.
        This is intended, as new objects do not always get detected immediately in the dense tracking setting.
