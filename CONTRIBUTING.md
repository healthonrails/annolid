## Developing Annolid
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
Detailed instructions for installing Annolid is here https://annolid.com.

## Updating the website / Jupyter Book
The Annolid website + Jupyter Book is deployed from `https://github.com/healthonrails/healthonrails.github.io`. See `docs/updating_jupyter_book_and_github_pages.md` for the build + publish workflow.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
